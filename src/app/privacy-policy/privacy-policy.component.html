                    <h4>Do we use 'cookies'?</h4>
                    <p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your web browser (if you allow) that enables the
                        site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us
                        remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity,
                        which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that
                        we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p>
                    <p>First Premier Home Warranty uses cookies to collect information around abandoned quotes. A quote is considered abandoned after one hour of inactivity/lack
                        of purchase. Once the timer has expired an SMS message will be sent as a reminder.</p>    
                    <h4>We use cookies to:</h4>

                    </ul>
                    <p>You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser
                        (like Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser's Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.</p>

                    <h4>Third party links</h4>
                    <p>We do not include or offer third party products or services on our website.</p>
                    <h4>Google</h4>
                    <p>Google's advertising requirements can be summed up by Google's Advertising Principles. They are put in place to provide a positive experience for users.
                    <a href="https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en"  target="_blank" class="c--fpLightBlue"> https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/1316548?hl=en</a></p>
                    <p>We use Google AdSense Advertising on our website.</p>

                    <p>Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit
                        to our site and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy</p>
                    <h4>We have implemented the following:</h4>

                        <li>DoubleClick Platform Integration</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We along with third-party vendors, such as Google use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the
                        DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to compile data regarding user interactions with ad impressions, and other ad service functions as
                        they relate to our website.</p>
                    <p>Opting out: Users can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Settings page. Alternatively, you can opt out by visiting the

                    <h4>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h4>     
                    <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond
                        California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information
                        from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it
                        is being shared, and to comply with this policy.

                    <h4>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</h4>   
                    <p>Users can visit our site anonymously Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page
                        after entering our website. Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on the page specified above.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0"><strong>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes:</strong></p> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>On our Privacy Policy Page</li>
                    </ul>    
                    <p class="mb-0"><strong> Users are able to change their personal information:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>By emailing us</li>
                        <li>By calling us</li>
                        <li>By logging in to their account</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>How does our site handle do not track signals?</h4>
                    <p>We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.</p>
                    <h4>Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</h4>
                    <p>It is also important to note that we do not allow third party behavioral tracking</p>
                    <h4>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h4>
                    <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.
                        The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online
                        services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>
                        <p>We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>
                    <h4>Fair Information Practices</h4>    
                    <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in
                        the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is
                        critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>
                    <h4>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data
                        breach occur:</h4>   
                    <p class="mb-0"><strong>We will notify the users via email</strong></p>   
                    <ul>
                        <li>Within 1 business day</li>

                    <p class="mb-0"><strong>We will notify the users via in site notification</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Within 1 business day</li>
                    </ul>  
                    <p>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and
                        processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals
                        have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
                    <h4>CAN SPAM Act</h4>    
                    <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have
                        emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>
                    <h4>We collect your email address in order to:</h4>    
                    <p class="mb-0"><strong>To be in accordance with CANSPAM we agree to the following:</strong></p>
