                    <h2>15. GOVERNING LAW; ARBITRATION; LEGAL FEES; NO CLASS CLAIMS; EQUITABLE RELIEF.</h2>

                    <p><strong>15.1 Governing Law.</strong>This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, excluding New York’s choice-of-law principles, and all claims arising out of or relating to your use of the Website, contacts between you and us (including telephone calls and text messages), this Agreement and/or any other understanding or arrangement between you and FPHW or any of the other FPHW Parties, or the breach of any thereof, whether sounding in contract, tort or otherwise, shall likewise be governed by the laws of the State of New York</p>
                        
                    <p>15.2 Arbitration; Legal Fees; No Jury Trial; No Class Actions; No Cross Claims. Any dispute with you or any person acting on your behalf (if applicable) which arises out of or is related to your use of the Website, this Agreement, and/or any other understanding or arrangement between you and FPHW or any of the other FPHW Parties, including without limitation regarding any breach of this Agreement, any contacts between you and FPHW (including, but not limited to, emails, telephone calls, and text message correspondence between us and you, including but not limited to, claims under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act), or any other such other understanding or arrangement, shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration administered by a private professional arbitrator and rules reasonably determined by the parties in writing, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. You and FPHW are expressly waiving any rights to a jury trial. The arbitration will be conducted in the State of New York, by an arbitrator with applicable industry expertise in the field of event management services, who shall be named in accordance with such rules. The award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on you and FPHW , and shall be accompanied by a statement of the reasons upon which the award is based, and such statement as well as all information concerning such arbitration proceedings including without limitation all evidence and materials submitted by you and FPHW and any decision rendered shall be deemed to be the confidential information of FPHW and shall not be made public by you or any person acting on your behalf or for your interest (and any submission made to any court as part of such a proceeding shall be made under seal). If the party initiating such a proceeding does not prevail regarding a material part of its claim, then the initiating party shall pay the responding party’s costs and expenses, including but not limited to reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs as well as the costs for any counter claim asserted by the responding party. NO ARBITRATION OR CLAIM UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE JOINED TO ANY OTHER ARBITRATION OR CLAIM, AND NO CLASS ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS SHALL BE PERMITTED. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or FPHW may apply to any federal or state court sitting in the County and State of New York for injunctive relief or enforcement of this arbitration provision, without breach of this arbitration provision, and you and FPHW each submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for such purpose. You and FPHW waive any right to assert any claims against the other party as a representative or member in any class or representative action. You agree that any and all claims, judgments and awards shall be limited to actual out-of-pocket costs incurred to a maximum of $1500 per claim, but in no event attorneys’ fees. You also agree that FPHW is not liable for consequential, incidental, indirect, secondary or punitive damages as you are waiving your rights to all such damages. You and FPHW each expressly waives any claim of improper venue and any claim that such courts are an inconvenient forum.</p>

                    <p><strong>15.3 Equitable Relief.</strong> You agree that it would be impossible or inadequate to measure and calculate FPHW’s damages from any breach of certain of the representations, warranties or covenants made, or obligations undertaken, by you in this Agreement. Accordingly, you agree that FPHW shall have the right to obtain an immediate injunction enjoining any breach or threatened breach of any your obligations under this Agreement which FPHW in its sole discretion believes will cause damage to any of the FPHW Parties, without having to post a bond or other security, and to specific performance of any such provision of this Agreement. The remedies of FPHW in connection with this Section shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other remedies to which FPHW may be entitled under this Agreement or otherwise at law or in equity. If FPHW prevails in any such proceeding, FPHW shall have the right to recover from you the costs and expenses thereof, including without limitation for reasonable attorneys’ fees. For purpose of this Section 15.3, you agree to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction by and venue of any federal or state court sitting in the County and State of New York for FPHW’s pursuit of such relief, without breach of the above arbitration provision, and you and FPHW submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for such purpose, and to receive service of process through certified mail or by other means sanctioned by law, and you expressly waive any claim of improper venue and any claim that such courts are an inconvenient forum.</p> 


                    <h2>6. TIMELY FILING OF CLAIMS.</h2>
                        
                    <p>YOU AGREE THAT REGARDLESS OF ANY STATUTE OR LAW TO THE CONTRARY, ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE, OR ANY CONTACTS BETWEEN SPHW AND YOU (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, TEXT MESSAGES, CALLS, OR EMAILS) OR OTHERWISE THIS AGREEMENT, MUST BE FILED BY YOU WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE OR IS CLAIMED TO HAVE ARISEN.</p>

                    <h2>17. ASSIGNMENT.</h2>

                        <p>You shall not sell, assign or otherwise transfer any of your rights or obligations under this Agreement, without FPHW’s prior written consent (to be provided or denied in our sole discretion). This Agreement may be automatically assigned by FPHW, in our sole discretion, to a third party, and such an assignment shall inure to the benefit of such third party or otherwise to our successors, assigns and/or licensees. Without limitation of the foregoing, we may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of our assets, including without limitation your PII, with any parent company, subsidiary, joint venture, or any company under our common control, as well as with a potential acquirer, in connection with a merger, reorganization, or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy. In each such an event, the PII we have collected from you may be one of the assets so transferred.</p>

                    <h2>18. VALIDITY; WAIVER.</h2> 
                    <p> If any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any of the other provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect, and this Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. If, moreover, any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall for any reason be held to be excessively broad as to duration, geographical scope, activity or subject, it shall be construed by limiting and reducing it, so as to be enforceable to the extent compatible with applicable law as it shall then appear. Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to a subsequent or similar breach or subsequent or similar breaches. If FPHW does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in this Agreement (or which FPHW has the benefit of exercising or enforcing under any applicable law), such non-exercise or non-enforcement shall not be taken to be a formal waiver of FPHW’s rights or remedies, and all such rights or remedies shall still be available to FPHW.</p>
                    <h2>19. GENERAL.</h2>
                    <p>Section headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of any such section. This Agreement and any additional applicable agreement between you and us sets forth the entire understanding and agreement between us with respect to the subject matter hereof. The provisions of this Agreement will survive termination or expiration to the extent necessary to carry out the intentions of you and us.</p>
